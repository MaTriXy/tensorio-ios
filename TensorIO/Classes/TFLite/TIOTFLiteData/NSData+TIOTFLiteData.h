/**
 * An `NSData` object may be an input to a TFLite tensor or an output from a TFLite tensor.
 *
 * The underlying bytes will be supplied directly to or accepted directly from a
 * TFLite tensor. NSData already implements both:
 *
 * @code
 * - (instancetype)initWithBytes:(const void *)bytes length:(NSUInteger)length
 * - (void)getBytes:(void *)buffer length:(NSUInteger)length`.
 * @endcode
 *
 * So we just pass initialization to those methods without making any assumptions about the type
 * of the data (`float_t` or `uint8_t`).
