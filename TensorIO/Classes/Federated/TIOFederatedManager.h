/**
 * Allows users to register for or request federated tasks from a TensorIO Flea
 * server and provide data to the model for those task. The
 * `TIOFederatedManager` coordinates between learning tasks, client-server
 * interactions, and actually executing training on a model.
 *
 * You must set a data source provider prior to registering for or requesting new
 * tasks. The data source provider vends instances of `TIOBatchDataSource` to
 * the manager, which are themselves responsible for providing batch data for
 * a task. You may return the data source provider itself if it also knows how
 * to vend data, but it is then that classes responsibility to only vend the
 * correct data for a specific task.
