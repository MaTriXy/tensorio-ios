# TensorIO Notebooks

These notebooks are used to produce the models against which TensorIO integration tests are performed. All backends must pass their respective integration tests for these models. The tests may be found in:

- *Example/TensorIOTFLiteModelIntegrationTests.mm* 
- *TensorFlowExample/TensorIOTensorFlowModelIntegrationTests.mm*
